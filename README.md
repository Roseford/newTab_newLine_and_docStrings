# newTab_newLine_and_docStrings
Two blocks of code, first one makes use of DOCUMENT STRINGS(''' ''') to make new lines and new tabs while the second block uses the BACKWARDS SLASH to make new lines(\n) and new tabs(\t).
Although the first block looks simpler, the second one gives a cleaner finishing.
